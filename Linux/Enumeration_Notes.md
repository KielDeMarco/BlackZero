#### What to look for:
When enumerating a website or a linux machine some of the things to look for are 
hidden directories, and domain names. We should also look at the source code of the website for vulnerabilites and use scanners to try and find vulnerabilities
We should look for version numbers and default credentials in order to gain initial foothold. Once we gain inital foothold we can look for writable
files and executables; look in the cronjob tab and try to access the /etc/passwd/ files and the /etc/shadow files.
